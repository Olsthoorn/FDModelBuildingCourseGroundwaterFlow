When we now use a model with more than one row, we can look at it as a set of simultaneously computed independent axisymmetric models, because these models all share the same distance from zero by their x-coordinate and have no mutual interaction in the y-direction.

    "The numerical and analytical solutions agree. Only the first point differs. This is because the flow was specified in the center of the first cell (between r=0 and r=r0), instead of at the border of that cell, i.e. at exactly r=r0. We can solve this in various ways. The best way is to make the first cell coordinates r0-delta and r0+delta, with delta some small number, so that the water is injected almost exactly at r=r0. I leave that as an exercise."

    "We now have a flexible 3D steady-state finite difference model which can be used to solve fully 3D problems as well as 2D problems and 1D problemns. It also can solve axisymmetrical problems, i.e. axisymmetical cross sections. With this model one  can also readily solve steady-state pumping tests in multilayer aquifers. But to show the results of such simulations it is useful to not only show the heads but also the stream function, i.e. the stream lines. This is the subject of the next chapter."
